    	<h4>Our Mission</h4>
    	<ul class="mission-list">
    		<h5>Our mission stems from the national watchword from 1 Timothy 4:12.</h5>
    		<li>To reach out to the lost youth, especially of The Apostolic Church that are within and outside the church.</li>
    		<li>To engage in Bible Study and teachings which will build the youths to become useful vessels in the church.</li>

    		<li>To serve as a unifying force or an instrument of unity both within and outside the church.</li>
    		<li>To uphold the Apostolic glorious vision of the first century.</li>
    		<li>It is to be a forum for the youth to show by example; the living in unity of the scripture as well as teaching it.</li>
    		<li>To help in reaching the little children through Sunday School, Child Evangelism and other useful programs.</li>
    		<li>TACSFON is not a revolutionary group against The Apostolic Church or the system; She is in cooperation with the church for the reign of true Apostolic vision of attending to biblical doctrine and fellowship (Acts 2:24), and the expansion of the kingdom of God through the ministry of the gospel of Jesus Christ as the answer to every need of man.</li>
    		<li>This is a religious organization which is obliged to give moral teaching, to its members as laid down in the Holy Bible.</li>
